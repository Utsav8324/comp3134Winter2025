The following security measures have been implemented:

1️⃣ **Prevent directory traversal**: 
   - Used `basename()` to ensure only the last part of the path is accessed.
   - This stops attackers from using `../` or encoded values (`%2e%2e%2f`).

2️⃣ **Check if the path exists**:
   - Used `file_exists()` to verify the requested directory exists.
   - If the directory is invalid, access is denied.

3️⃣ **Only allow directories, not files**:
   - Used `is_dir()` to ensure the requested path is a directory.
   - This prevents attackers from reading sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

✅ These fixes prevent directory traversal attacks and unauthorized file access.
