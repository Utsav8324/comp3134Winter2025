the page lists files and directories outside the web root (/var/www/html/), potentially exposing sensitive system files.

Sensitive Data Exposed:

Users can view files and directories outside the intended scope, which may include configuration files, logs, and even password files.
If the server has weak permissions, attackers might be able to access files like:
/etc/passwd (User information)
/etc/shadow (Password hashes)
/var/log/auth.log (Authentication logs)
Potential Risk:

Hackers could extract sensitive information and use it for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the system.
If the PHP script allows file reading, an attacker could retrieve confidential data by modifying the query string (e.g., q=../../../../../etc/passwd).
